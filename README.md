# **RedReport**

### _You don't have to suffer alone_

RedReport is an anonymous crowdsourced reporting tool, building safe communities by addressing the fear of speaking up.

RedReport allows members of a community to report offenses they have experienced to a public system, providing incoming employees, homeowners or customers a different way to evaluate the community.

By not accusing an offender of any crime and not offering legal services, RedReport positions itself as a complementary step to addressing injustice, encouraging accountability at a management level. Redreport focuses on providing victims with anonymous support resources after any aggression. Simultaneously, through its reporting data, it can track both positive and negative trends, holding communities accountable while also rewarding meaningful change.

## Current Version

RedReport is preparing for launch at the University of Notre Dame, acting as a student-run campus reporting tool. Within these early phases, RedReport is undergoing constant redesigning and updating, proving its concept within a limited market.
