## Feature Description:

- After a certain amount of incidents in a specific area send push notification to RedReport Team

- Track number of individuals involved in the incident to adjust how risk score.\*

* If you choose to only do this one, you need to find a way to make it more complex and useful than just adding a field.

## Potential Implementations:

- Make an API call to a [CloudFare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) within React code that calls (Slack, Email, Webhook, etc) API.
- Add field in to later insert into Report form.

## Skills required:

JS, API Connections, React

## Core Concepts Suggested

### Notification

1. **Serverless Workers:** Script running in the cloud called through the React code
2. **API endpoint:** Method to connect to services outside the website

### Individuals Involved

1. **HTML form submission:** Logic when submitting form and connection to Firebase.
2. **HTML Input Types:** How users can input or select values understandable by the logic.

## Requirements:

### Must integrate into the Notification Element into one of the /components/pages or /components/UI files.

### CANNOT Copy, paste unmodified elements from tutorials. Instead you must add unique touch through multiple (or all) of the following:

- Design matching Redreport branding.
- Research into campus and local resources to add as content.
- Unique feature not previously mentioned.
- Unique placement within webapp not previously mentioned.
