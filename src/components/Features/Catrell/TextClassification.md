## Feature Description:

- Classification of open ended "additional information" field through LLM.

## Potential Implementations:

- Fetch Firebase data and make an API call to a [OpenRouter Model](https://openrouter.ai/models?fmt=cards&max_price=0&order=top-weekly)

## Skills required:

Python, API Connections, Prompt Engineering

## Core Concepts Suggested

### Text Classification

1. **Python Script:** Code developers can run seperate from the user web application
2. **API endpoint:** Method to connect to services outside the website

## Requirements:

### LLM model CANNOT interact with the web application directly due to high risk.

### CANNOT Copy, paste unmodified elements from tutorials. Instead you must add unique touch through multiple (or all) of the following:

- Design matching Redreport branding.
- Research into campus and local resources to add as content.
- Unique feature not previously mentioned.
- Unique placement within webapp not previously mentioned.

## Resources to learn:

### Create your own AI tutor:

#### Further exploration:

_We do not have example data to train a machine learning model, however if you would want to explore these a bit more I added some resources as well_
